The documentation in this section is intended for developers and operators interested in creating Managed Services for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>. Managed Services are defined as having been integrated with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> through APIs, and enable end users to provision reserved resources and credentials on demand. For documentation targeted at end users, such as how to provision services and integrate them with apps, see [Services](overview.html).

To develop Managed Services for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you need a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance to test your service broker with as you are developing it. You must have admin access to your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance to manage service brokers and the services marketplace catalog. For local development, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends using the [BOSH guide](https://bosh.io/docs/quick-start/) to deploy your own local instance of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> using VirtualBox.
